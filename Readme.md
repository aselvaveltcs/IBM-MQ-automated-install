Author: [Roman Kharkovski](http://kharkovski.blogspot.com/).

This repository is a Bash script for Linux to install IBM MQ with a single command. Instead of following a complex setup process and navigating many pages of product documentation, this script allows for "one click" creation of the entire environment and can be easily customized to suit individual needs of a user.
